Repeat for several sets of 10-15 reps.</p><p>Planks are another great exercise that can be done anywhere, including your living room.

Start in a plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower your body down, keeping your elbows close to your sides, and then push back up. Repeat for several sets of 10-15 reps.</p><p><h3>At Home Workouts to Lose Weight for Beginners</h3></p><p>If you're new to working out or haven't exercised in a while, it's important to start with at home workouts to lose weight that are suitable for your fitness level.
