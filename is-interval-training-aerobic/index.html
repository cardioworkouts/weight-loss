<meta name="description" content="How highintensity interval training keeps you young Arena DistrictAre you tired of spending hours on the treadmill with little to no results? Do you want to increase your endurance and burn more calories in less time? If so, you may have heard about interval training. But is interval training aerobic? In this post, we&#39;ll answer this question and provide you with a complete guide to interval training.Many people struggle with traditional aerobic exercise because it can be monotonous and time-consuming.
