I appreciate the flexibility it provides, allowing me to create and save custom intervals for different types of workouts. I also love that it allows me to label each interval, so I can easily keep track of what I'm doing.</p><p>One potential downside of Interval Timer is that it can be a bit overwhelming at first.

However, once you get the hang of it, the app is incredibly useful.</p><p><h2>Other Options to Consider</h2></p><p>While we believe that Interval Timer is the best free workout timer app for iPhone, there are several other options worth considering:</p><p><h3>Seconds Pro</h3></p><p>Seconds Pro is another popular option for workout timer apps. It's known for its simplicity and ease of use. However, some users have reported that the app can be buggy and may crash from time to time.</p><p><h3>MyWOD</h3></p><p>MyWOD is a workout timer app specifically designed for CrossFit workouts. It comes with pre-programmed workouts and allows you to track your progress over time. However, it's not as customizable as some of the other options on this list.</p><p><h3>Tabata Stopwatch Pro</h3></p><p>Tabata Stopwatch Pro is a timer app designed specifically for Tabata workouts. It comes with pre-programmed workouts and allows you to create custom workouts as well.

Customize Your Intervals</h4></p><p>Most workout timer apps allow you to customize your intervals. Take advantage of this feature to create workouts that are tailored to your needs. For example, if you're trying to build strength, you might want to create intervals that allow you to lift heavy weights for shorter periods of time.</p><p><h4>3. Stay Focused</h4></p><p>When you're using a workout timer app, it can be tempting to check your phone or get distracted by other things. However, it's important to stay focused on your workout. Use your app to keep yourself accountable and stay on track.</p><p><h4>4. Track Your Progress</h4></p><p>Finally, use your workout timer app to track your progress over time.
