Do you struggle to find motivation to keep going during your runs? Look no further, because we have compiled a list of the best running songs ever that will have you pumped up and ready to tackle any distance.</p><p>Many runners struggle with finding the right music to listen to during their workouts. Some songs may be too slow and calming, while others may be too fast and distracting. It's important to find a happy medium that will keep you energized and motivated throughout your entire run.</p><p>The target of this article is to provide a comprehensive list of the best running songs ever, along with the reasons why they are perfect for running. We have taken into consideration the beats per minute (BPM), lyrics, and overall vibe of each song to ensure they will keep you moving and motivated.</p><p>In summary, this article will provide you with a list of the best running songs ever, explain why they are perfect for running, and offer tips on how to create your own running playlist.</p><h2>The Power of Music: Why Running with the Right Playlist is Essential</h2><p>Music has the power to enhance our mood, emotions, and overall performance. When it comes to running, the right playlist can make all the difference in the world. Personally, I have experienced the benefits of running with a well-curated playlist. The right songs help me keep a consistent pace, motivate me to keep going, and distract me from any discomfort or fatigue.</p><p>Research has also shown that listening to music while exercising can decrease fatigue, increase endurance, and improve overall performance. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness found that runners who listened to music while running had a significantly lower heart rate and perceived exertion compared to those who ran in silence.</p><h2>The Best Running Songs Ever: Our Top Picks</h2><p>1. "Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor - With its iconic opening guitar riff and motivational lyrics, this classic song is perfect for any runner looking to feel like a champion.</p><p>2. "Can't Hold Us" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis - This upbeat and fast-paced song will have you feeling like you can conquer any distance.</p><p>3. "Lose Yourself" by Eminem - The intense lyrics and driving beat of this song make it perfect for pushing through any tough spot in your run.</p><p>4. "Don't Stop the Music" by Rihanna - The catchy chorus and danceable beat of this song will keep you energized and motivated throughout your entire run.</p><p>5. "Born to Run" by Bruce Springsteen - This classic rock hit is the perfect ode to the joys and struggles of running.</p><h2>Creating Your Own Running Playlist</h2><p>While our list of the best running songs ever is a great starting point, it's important to create your own personalized playlist that speaks to your individual tastes and preferences. Here are some tips for creating the perfect running playlist:</p><p>- Choose songs with a BPM that matches your preferred running pace</p><p>- Mix up the genres and styles of music to keep things interesting</p><p>- Include songs with motivational lyrics and uplifting messages</p><p>- Don't be afraid to add some guilty pleasure songs that make you happy and energized</p><h3>The Science Behind BPM: Choosing the Right Songs for Your Pace</h3><p>The beats per minute (BPM) of a song can greatly affect your running pace and performance. Generally, songs with a higher BPM are ideal for faster running paces, while songs with a lower BPM are better suited for slower, more relaxed runs.</p><p>For example, a song with a BPM of 180 is perfect for a 6-minute mile pace, while a song with a BPM of 120 is better suited for a 10-minute mile pace. You can easily find the BPM of your favorite songs online or through running apps like Spotify or Nike Run Club.</p><h4>Tips for Staying Motivated During Long Runs</h4><p>Long runs can be mentally and physically challenging, but the right playlist can help you push through any tough spots. Here are some tips for staying motivated during long runs:</p><p>- Choose songs with a slow build-up that gradually increase in intensity</p><p>- Include songs that remind you of positive memories or experiences</p><p>- Break up your run into smaller segments and choose a different song for each segment</p><p>- Use the lyrics of the songs as mantras to keep you motivated and focused</p><h2>FAQs About the Best Running Songs Ever</h2><p><strong>Q: Can I listen to podcasts or audiobooks while running instead of music?</strong></p><p>A: While podcasts and audiobooks are great sources of entertainment, they may not provide the same motivational benefits as music. Additionally, the tempo and intensity of the content may not be conducive to maintaining a consistent running pace.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use wireless headphones while running?</strong></p><p>A: Absolutely! Wireless headphones are a great option for runners who don't want to deal with the hassle of cords and wires. Just be sure to choose headphones that are sweat and water-resistant to protect them during your runs.</p><p><strong>Q: How often should I update my running playlist?</strong></p><p>A: It's a good idea to update your running playlist every few weeks or whenever you start to feel bored or unmotivated during your runs. Adding new songs and switching up the order can help keep things fresh and exciting.</p><p><strong>Q: What if I don't like any of the songs on the best running songs ever list?</strong></p><p>A: No problem! The best running songs ever list is simply a starting point. Feel free to add or remove songs as needed to create a playlist that works best for you and your running goals.</p><h2>Conclusion of Best Running Songs Ever</h2><p>Running with the right playlist can make all the difference in the world.
