By understanding retail price, I was able to identify the better deal and save $100.</p><p><h2>What Affects Retail Price?</h2></p><p>There are several factors that can affect retail price, including:</p><p><h3>1. Manufacturing Costs</h3></p><p>The cost of manufacturing a product can affect its retail price.

Just make sure to buy from a reputable seller and check the product's condition before buying.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><h4>Q: What is the difference between retail price and wholesale price?</h4></p><p>A: Wholesale price is the price at which a product is sold to retailers, while retail price is the price at which a product is sold to the end consumer. Wholesale price is typically lower than retail price, as it does not include the costs of marketing, transportation, and storage that retailers incur.</p><p><h4>Q: Why do some products have a high retail price?</h4></p><p>A: Some products have a high retail price because they are expensive to manufacture, transport, and store.
