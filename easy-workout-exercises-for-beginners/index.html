They're also an excellent way to build strength, flexibility, and endurance.</p><p><h2>Squats</h2></p><p>When I first started exercising, squats were one of the exercises that I found easy to do. Squats are a great way to improve your lower body strength, especially your glutes, hamstrings, and quadriceps. To do squats, start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. Slowly lower your hips, keeping your back straight until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Then slowly rise back up to the starting position.</p><p><h2>Push-ups</h2></p><p>Push-ups can be challenging, but they're an excellent way to build upper body strength, especially your chest, shoulders, and triceps. Start by getting into a plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower your body until your chest touches the floor, then push yourself back up to the starting position.</p><p><h3>Planks</h3></p><p>Planks are a great way to build core strength, which is essential for overall fitness. Start by getting into a push-up position, but instead of lowering your body, hold the position for as long as you can. Make sure to keep your back straight and your core engaged.</p><p><h4>Lunges</h4></p><p>Lunges are a great way to work on your lower body strength, especially your glutes, hamstrings, and quadriceps. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. Take a step forward with one foot, keeping your knee directly above your ankle. Lower your body until your back knee is almost touching the floor, then rise back up to the starting position. Repeat with the other leg.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><b>Q:</b> Can I do easy workout exercises for beginners every day?</p><p><b>A:</b> Yes, you can do these exercises every day.
