However, not everyone enjoys running or going to the gym. Fortunately, there are plenty of other options for getting your heart rate up, and one of the most popular is riding a bicycle. But is riding a bicycle good cardio exercise? Let's find out.</p><p>Many people struggle with finding a form of cardio exercise that they enjoy.
