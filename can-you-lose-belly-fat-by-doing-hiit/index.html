Insulin resistance occurs when your body becomes less sensitive to insulin, which leads to high blood sugar levels and fat storage around the belly.</p><p>Personally, I have been doing HIIT for a few months now, and I have seen a significant reduction in my belly fat. I used to do traditional cardio for hours, but it never targeted my belly fat. However, with HIIT, I can feel my stomach getting tighter and leaner.</p><p><h2>How to Incorporate HIIT into Your Fitness Routine to Lose Belly Fat?</h2></p><p>Before starting any new exercise routine, it is essential to consult your doctor.
