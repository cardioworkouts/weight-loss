Keep your body in a straight line from your head to your feet, and hold the position for as long as you can.</p><p><h3>Russian Twists</h3></p><p>Russian twists are another effective exercise for targeting your upper belly fat. To do a Russian twist, sit on the ground with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Lean back slightly, and lift your feet off the ground. Twist your torso to the right, and touch your right hand to the ground. Twist back to the center, and then twist to the left, touching your left hand to the ground.</p><p><h2>Cardio Exercises</h2></p><p>The following cardio exercises can help you burn overall body fat:</p><p><h3>Running</h3></p><p>Running is an excellent cardio exercise that can help you burn fat and calories.

You can cycle outdoors or use a stationary bike at the gym.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I spot reduce upper belly fat with exercise?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> No, you cannot spot reduce fat. You need to focus on overall weight loss through a combination of strength training and cardio.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How often should I do strength training exercises?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Aim to do strength training exercises at least two to three times per week.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How much cardio should I do?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio or 75 minutes of high-intensity cardio per week.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I do ab exercises every day?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can do ab exercises every day, but it's important to give your muscles time to rest and recover.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of What is the Best Exercise for Upper Belly Fat?</h2></p><p>While you can't spot reduce fat, incorporating strength training and cardio exercises into your workout routine can help you burn overall body fat and strengthen your core, which can contribute to reducing upper belly fat.
