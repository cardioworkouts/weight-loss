Do you want to know the benefits and drawbacks of doing cardio before weight lifting? If yes, then you are at the right place. Many people are confused about whether they should do cardio before weight lifting or not. They worry that cardio will tire them out and make it harder for them to lift weights. They also wonder if doing cardio before weight lifting will negatively impact their muscle gains. The answer to the question &#34;can I do cardio before weight lifting?&#34; is yes, you can.
