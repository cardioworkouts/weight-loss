Incorporate exercises that target different muscle groups, such as squats, lunges, push-ups, and planks. Aim for 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions of each exercise.</p><h3>Cool-Down</h3><p>Finally, end your workout with a 5-10 minute cool-down. This can include stretching or light yoga to help your muscles recover and prevent soreness.</p><h2>Tips for Staying Motivated and Consistent</h2><p>Creating a daily exercise routine at home to lose weight is just the first step.
