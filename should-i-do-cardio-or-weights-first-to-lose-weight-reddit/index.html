Always</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Are you trying to lose weight but not sure whether to start with cardio or weights? There's a lot of information out there and it can be overwhelming to know what to do. In this post, we'll explore the question of whether you should do cardio or weights first to lose weight on Reddit. </p><p>When it comes to weight loss, one of the biggest pain points is figuring out the most effective workout routine that will give you the results you want. Many people turn to Reddit for advice, but with so much conflicting information, it can be difficult to know where to start. </p><p>The short answer to the question of whether you should do cardio or weights first to lose weight on Reddit is that it depends on your goals. </p><p>If your main goal is to lose weight and burn fat, then cardio is a great starting point. Cardio exercises like running, cycling, or swimming get your heart rate up and help you burn calories. </p><p>However, if you want to build muscle and improve your overall fitness level, then weights should be your first priority. Lifting weights or doing bodyweight exercises like push-ups or squats will help you build muscle and increase your metabolism, making it easier to lose weight in the long run. </p><h2>My Personal Experience with Cardio and Weights</h2><p>When I first started my weight loss journey, I focused primarily on cardio. I would spend hours on the treadmill or elliptical machine, trying to burn as many calories as possible. While I did lose weight, I soon realized that I wasn't seeing the results I wanted. </p><p>After some research, I started incorporating weightlifting into my routine. I was nervous at first, but I quickly fell in love with lifting weights. Not only did I start seeing more muscle definition, but I also noticed that I was burning more calories throughout the day. </p><h2>The Benefits of Doing Cardio First</h2><p>If you decide to start with cardio, there are several benefits to keep in mind. First, cardio is a great way to warm up your muscles and get your heart rate up before moving on to weights. This can help prevent injury and ensure that you're getting the most out of your workout. </p><p>Second, cardio is a great way to burn calories and jumpstart your weight loss journey. By doing cardio first, you'll be able to burn more calories during your workout and throughout the day. </p><h3>The Benefits of Doing Weights First</h3><p>On the other hand, if you decide to start with weights, there are several benefits to consider. First, lifting weights will help you build muscle, which is important for increasing your metabolism and burning more calories. </p><p>Second, lifting weights can improve your overall fitness level and help you reach your goals faster. By building muscle, you'll be able to lift heavier weights and do more challenging exercises, which will help you get stronger and more toned. </p><h4>How to Decide Which to Do First</h4><p>If you're still not sure whether to start with cardio or weights, here are some tips to help you decide:</p><ul><li>Consider your goals. If your main goal is to lose weight, then cardio may be the best starting point. If you want to build muscle and improve your overall fitness level, then weights should be your first priority.</li><li>Think about your current fitness level. If you're new to working out, then starting with cardio may be a good idea. If you're already in good shape and looking to take your fitness to the next level, then weights may be a better choice.</li><li>Try both and see what works best for you. Everyone's body is different, so it's important to experiment and see what works for you. Try doing cardio first for a few weeks, then switch to weights and see how your body responds.</li></ul><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q:</strong> Should I do cardio or weights first?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> It depends on your goals. If you want to lose weight and burn fat, then cardio may be the best starting point. If you want to build muscle and improve your overall fitness level, then weights should be your first priority.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is it better to do cardio and weights on the same day?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it's okay to do cardio and weights on the same day. Just be sure to warm up properly and give yourself time to recover between exercises.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How often should I do cardio and weights?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> It's recommended to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio per week and to do strength training exercises at least two days per week. </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I lose weight by just doing cardio?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can lose weight by just doing cardio. However, adding weightlifting to your routine can help you burn more calories and improve your overall fitness level.</p><h2>Conclusion of Should I Do Cardio or Weights First to Lose Weight Reddit</h2><p>So, should you do cardio or weights first to lose weight on Reddit? The answer is that it depends on your goals and fitness level. Whether you decide to start with cardio or weights, the most important thing is to find a routine that works for you and stick with it. Remember to warm up properly, give yourself time to recover, and stay consistent with your workouts. With time and dedication, you'll be able to achieve your weight loss goals and improve your overall health and fitness.</p></article>
