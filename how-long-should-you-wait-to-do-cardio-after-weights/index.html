Well, you're not alone. Many people are also in the same boat as you, and it's understandable.

People often worry that if they don't do cardio immediately after weight training, they will lose their muscle gains. Others are concerned about their energy levels and want to avoid feeling tired or fatigued during their cardio sessions. Finally, some individuals may be unsure of the proper order of exercises and want to avoid doing them in the wrong sequence.</p><h2>Answering the Target of How Long Should You Wait to Do Cardio After Weights</h2><p>The general consensus among fitness experts is that you should wait at least 20-30 minutes after weight training before starting your cardio session. This period allows your body to replenish energy stores and recover from the weight training. Additionally, it gives your muscles time to relax and recover from the intense workout. Waiting for 20-30 minutes also helps ensure that you are not too fatigued during your cardio session.</p><p>However, the ideal waiting time before doing cardio after weights varies depending on your fitness level and goals. If you're a beginner, you may want to wait longer before starting cardio to avoid fatigue and optimize your results. On the other hand, if you're an experienced athlete, you may have a shorter waiting time before starting cardio.</p><h2>Summary of How Long Should You Wait to Do Cardio After Weights</h2><p>In summary, the ideal waiting time before doing cardio after weights is 20-30 minutes.
