<meta name="description" content="One question I get asked all the time is when should I do cardioAre you struggling to lose weight and wondering how long you should do cardio for weight loss? You are not alone. Many people are confused about how much cardio they need to do to lose weight, and they often end up doing too much or too little. In this article, we will answer the question of how long should i do cardio for weight loss and provide some useful tips to help you achieve your weight loss goals.Cardio is an essential component of any weight loss program. It helps you burn calories and fat, which are the two primary factors that contribute to weight gain. However, it&#39;s not just about how long you do cardio for weight loss. The intensity and type of cardio exercise you do also play a crucial role in determining how effective your weight loss program will be.The American Heart Association recommends that adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity cardio per week. This translates to about 30 minutes of cardio per day, five days a week. However, if you want to lose weight faster, you may need to increase the amount of cardio you do. In summary, the answer to the question of how long should i do cardio for weight loss is at least 30 minutes per day, five days a week. However, if you want to lose weight faster, you may need to increase the amount of cardio you do. Personal ExperienceWhen I first started my weight loss journey, I was doing 30 minutes of cardio six days a week. However, I wasn&#39;t seeing the results I wanted, so I increased my cardio to 45 minutes six days a week, and I started seeing a significant improvement in my weight loss.
