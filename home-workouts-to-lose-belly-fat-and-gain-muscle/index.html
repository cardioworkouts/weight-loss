I would repeat this circuit for 10-15 minutes, depending on my energy level.</p><p>For bodyweight training, I would do 3 sets of 10 push-ups, 3 sets of 10 squats, and 3 sets of 10 lunges. I would rest for 30 seconds between sets and repeat the circuit 3 times.</p><p>Overall, I found that consistency was key in seeing results.
