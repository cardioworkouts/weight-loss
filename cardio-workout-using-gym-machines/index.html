As someone who has struggled with knee pain, I was hesitant to use the treadmill at first. However, I found that by starting slow and gradually increasing my speed and incline, I was able to build up my endurance and strengthen my legs.When using the treadmill, make sure to warm up for at least five minutes at a slow speed before increasing your pace. Keep your posture upright and your arms relaxed at your sides. If you&#39;re new to using the treadmill, start with a flat surface and gradually increase the incline as you feel comfortable.The Elliptical MachineThe elliptical machine is another popular choice for cardio workout. It provides a low-impact workout that is easy on the joints while still providing a challenging workout for the legs and arms.When using the elliptical machine, make sure to keep your feet flat on the pedals and your posture upright. Use the handles to engage your upper body and increase the intensity of your workout. You can also adjust the resistance level to increase the difficulty of the workout.Stationary BikeThe stationary bike is a great option for those looking for a low-impact cardio workout. It provides a smooth ride that is easy on the joints while still challenging the legs and cardiovascular system.When using the stationary bike, make sure to adjust the seat height so that your feet can comfortably reach the pedals. Keep your posture upright and your hands on the handlebars. You can adjust the resistance level to increase the intensity of the workout.Rowing MachineThe rowing machine is an excellent full-body workout that engages the arms, legs, and core.

Use your arms, legs, and core to complete each stroke, and adjust the resistance level to increase the difficulty of the workout.Question and AnswerQ: How long should my cardio workout be?A: Aim for at least 30 minutes of cardio workout per day, five days a week. You can break this up into smaller increments throughout the day if needed.Q: Should I do cardio workout before or after strength training?A: It&#39;s best to do cardio workout after strength training, as this will ensure that you have enough energy to complete your weightlifting routine.Q: How often should I switch up my cardio routine?A: It&#39;s a good idea to switch up your cardio routine every four to six weeks to prevent boredom and ensure that you&#39;re challenging your body in new ways.Q: Can I do cardio workout every day?A: Yes, you can do cardio workout every day, but make sure to listen to your body and take rest days as needed.Conclusion of Cardio Workout using Gym MachinesCardio workout using gym machines is an excellent way to improve your cardiovascular health, build endurance, and burn calories.
