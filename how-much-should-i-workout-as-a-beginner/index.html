It can be overwhelming to figure out how much exercise is appropriate for your fitness level, especially if you're new to the world of fitness. In this blog post, we'll discuss how much you should workout as a beginner and provide tips to help you get started on your fitness journey.</p><p>As a beginner, you may be experiencing pain points such as a lack of knowledge about how much exercise you should be doing and doubts about your fitness level. You may also be unsure of what types of exercises to do and how often to do them. These pain points can make it difficult for you to start your fitness journey with confidence.</p><p>So, how much should you workout as a beginner? The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week. This can be broken down into 30 minutes of exercise five days a week or 25 minutes of exercise six days a week. In addition to cardio, you should also aim to do strength training exercises at least two days a week.</p><p>In summary, as a beginner, you should aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week. You should also incorporate strength training exercises into your routine at least two days a week.</p><p><h2>Personal Experience</h2></p><p>When I first started my fitness journey, I was unsure of how much exercise I should be doing. I started by doing 30 minutes of cardio five days a week and two days of strength training. As I progressed, I increased my exercise time to 45 minutes of cardio five days a week and three days of strength training. It's important to listen to your body and gradually increase your exercise time as you become more comfortable.</p><p><h2>Tips for Beginners</h2></p><p>1. Start slow - don't push yourself too hard in the beginning. Gradually increase your exercise time as you become more comfortable.</p><p>2. Find an exercise routine that works for you - try different types of exercises until you find something you enjoy. This will make it easier for you to stick to your routine.</p><p>3. Schedule your workouts - set aside specific times during the week for exercise. This will help you stay consistent with your routine.</p><p>4. Don't forget to rest - rest days are just as important as exercise days. Make sure to give your body time to recover.</p><p><h2>Importance of Exercise</h2></p><p>Exercise has numerous benefits for your physical and mental health. It can help improve your cardiovascular health, increase your strength and endurance, and boost your mood. Regular exercise can also help reduce your risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.</p><p><h3>Types of Exercise</h3></p><p>There are two main types of exercise: aerobic and strength training. Aerobic exercise, also known as cardio, includes activities such as running, cycling, and swimming. Strength training exercises include activities such as weight lifting and bodyweight exercises. It's important to incorporate both types of exercise into your routine to get the most benefits.</p><p><h4>Tips for Strength Training</h4></p><p>1. Start with bodyweight exercises - if you're new to strength training, start with exercises that use your bodyweight such as push-ups, squats, and lunges.</p><p>2. Use proper form - make sure you're using proper form when doing strength training exercises to prevent injury.</p><p>3. Gradually increase weight - as you become more comfortable with strength training, gradually increase the amount of weight you're lifting.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of How Much Should I Workout as a Beginner</h2></p><p>As a beginner, it's important to start slow and gradually increase your exercise time. Aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week, and incorporate strength training exercises into your routine at least two days a week. Find an exercise routine that works for you and don't forget to rest. Regular exercise has numerous benefits for your physical and mental health, so start your fitness journey today!</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><b>Q:</b> Can I do more than 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week?</p><p><b>A:</b> Yes, you can do more than 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week.
