I started running a few years ago, and it has been a game-changer for me. Not only have I lost weight, but I have also improved my endurance and overall health.</p><p>Running is a great form of cardiovascular exercise, but it is not the only option. Cycling, swimming, and dancing are also excellent choices. The key is to find an activity that you enjoy and stick with it.

Start by setting small, achievable goals for yourself. For example, aim to go for a 30-minute walk every day for a week. Once you have achieved this goal, set a new one, such as running for 10 minutes without stopping.</p><p>It is also essential to find a workout buddy or accountability partner. Having someone to exercise with can make the experience more enjoyable and help keep you motivated.
