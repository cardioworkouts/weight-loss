In this article, we'll explore the benefits and drawbacks of doing cardio after a workout to help you make an informed decision.</p><p>It's no secret that exercise is essential for optimal health.

While some experts argue that cardio before weightlifting is the best approach, others believe that it's better to do cardio after a workout.

By doing cardio after weightlifting, your body can use stored fats as fuel, helping you burn more calories and lose weight faster. Additionally, doing cardio after a workout can help flush out lactic acid from your muscles, reducing soreness and fatigue.</p><p>In summary, the order in which you perform your workouts depends on your fitness goals. If you're looking to build muscle and strength, weightlifting should be your priority. However, if fat loss and cardiovascular health are your primary objectives, doing cardio after a workout can be the best approach.</p><p><h2>My Personal Experience with Doing Cardio After a Workout</h2></p><p>I have been following a workout routine for the past year, and I always do cardio after weightlifting.
