It’s time to take a closer look at what exercise to do to lose love handles.</p><p>The truth is, love handles are a common problem for many people. They can make you feel self-conscious and affect your confidence. But the good news is, there are specific exercises that can help you lose those love handles and get back in shape.</p><p>If you want to know what exercise to do to lose love handles, keep reading. In this article, we’ll discuss the best exercises that can help you target those stubborn love handles.</p><p>When it comes to losing love handles, there’s no magic formula. You need to put in the effort and be consistent with your exercise routine. The right combination of cardio and strength training can help you burn fat and tone your muscles. Here are some of the best exercises that can help you lose love handles:</p><p><h2>1. Russian Twist</h2></p><p>One of the best exercises for targeting love handles is the Russian twist. This exercise is great for working your obliques, the muscles that run along the sides of your waistline. To do the Russian twist, sit on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Lean back slightly and lift your feet off the ground. Then, twist your torso to the right and touch your hands to the floor. Twist to the left and touch your hands to the floor again. Do 10 to 12 reps for three sets.</p><p>I have personally tried the Russian twist, and I can tell you it’s a great exercise for targeting love handles. It’s challenging, but the results are worth it.</p><p><h2>2. Bicycle Crunches</h2></p><p>Bicycle crunches are another effective exercise for targeting love handles. This exercise works your abs and obliques, helping to tone your waistline. To do bicycle crunches, lie on your back with your hands behind your head. Lift your knees to a 90-degree angle and start pedaling your legs like you’re riding a bicycle. As you pedal, twist your torso to the right and touch your left elbow to your right knee. Twist to the left and touch your right elbow to your left knee. Do 10 to 12 reps for three sets.</p><p>I find bicycle crunches to be a fun exercise that targets my love handles. It’s a great way to mix up my workout routine.</p><p><h2>3. Plank with Hip Dips</h2></p><p>The plank with hip dips is an excellent exercise for targeting not only your love handles but also your abs and core. To do this exercise, start in a plank position with your elbows on the ground and your body in a straight line. Then, dip your hips to the right and touch the floor. Return to the plank position and dip your hips to the left and touch the floor. Do 10 to 12 reps for three sets.</p><p>The plank with hip dips is a challenging exercise, but it’s great for targeting multiple areas of your body. I like to include this exercise in my workout routine to keep my core and love handles in shape.</p><p><h2>4. Side Plank</h2></p><p>The side plank is another effective exercise for targeting your love handles. This exercise works your obliques, helping to tone your waistline. To do the side plank, start in a plank position with your elbows on the ground and your body in a straight line. Then, turn your body to the right and lift your left arm up. Hold this position for 30 seconds and then switch sides. Do three sets on each side.</p><p>The side plank is a simple exercise that can help you tone your love handles. I like to do this exercise at the end of my workout to finish strong.</p><p><h3>Conclusion</h3></p><p>If you’re looking for what exercise to do to lose love handles, the four exercises mentioned above can help you get started. Remember, consistency is key when it comes to losing love handles. Try to include these exercises in your workout routine and be patient. With time and effort, you’ll see the results you want.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><b>Q:</b> How many times a week should I do these exercises?</p><p><b>A:</b> Aim to do these exercises three to four times a week for best results.</p><p><b>Q:</b> Can I do these exercises at home?</p><p><b>A:</b> Yes, all of these exercises can be done at home with little to no equipment required.</p><p><b>Q:</b> How long does it take to see results?</p><p><b>A:</b> It varies from person to person, but with consistent exercise and a healthy diet, you should see results in a few weeks to a couple of months.</p><p><b>Q:</b> Can I do these exercises if I have back pain?</p><p><b>A:</b> It’s best to consult with a doctor or a certified trainer if you have back pain.
