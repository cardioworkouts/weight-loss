Squats are a compound exercise that targets multiple muscle groups at once, including your glutes, quads, and hamstrings. To perform a squat, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing forward. Slowly lower your body as if you're sitting back into a chair, keeping your back straight and your knees behind your toes. Then, push through your heels to stand back up. Repeat for 3 sets of 10-15 reps.</p><p><h2>Planks</h2></p><p>Planks are another great exercise for weight loss that you can do at home. Planks work your core muscles, which can help improve your posture and balance. To perform a plank, start in a push-up position with your arms straight and your hands shoulder-width apart. Lower your forearms to the ground and hold your body in a straight line from your head to your heels. Hold for 30-60 seconds, then release.</p><p><h3>Jumping Jacks</h3></p><p>Jumping jacks are a fun and effective way to get your heart rate up and burn calories. To perform jumping jacks, stand with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Jump your feet out to shoulder-width apart while raising your arms above your head. Then, jump back to the starting position. Repeat for 3 sets of 20 reps.</p><p><h4>Lunges</h4></p><p>Lunges are another great exercise for weight loss that you can do at home. Lunges target your glutes, quads, and hamstrings and can help improve your balance and stability. To perform a lunge, stand with your feet hip-width apart and your hands on your hips. Take a step forward with your right foot and lower your body until your right knee is bent at a 90-degree angle. Then, push back up to the starting position and repeat on the left side. Repeat for 3 sets of 10-15 reps on each side.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q: How often should I do these exercises?</strong></p><p>A: To see results, aim to do these exercises at least 3-4 times a week.</p><p><strong>Q: Do I need any equipment for these exercises?</strong></p><p>A: No, you don't need any equipment for these exercises.
