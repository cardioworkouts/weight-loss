The deadlift is an excellent exercise that targets multiple muscle groups simultaneously. It is a compound exercise that works on your back, glutes, hamstrings, and core muscles. It is one of the best weight lifting exercises for belly fat.</p><p>Begin by standing with your feet hip-width apart and your toes pointing forward. Place the barbell in front of your feet and grab it with an overhand grip. Keep your back straight and lift the bar off the ground by pushing through your heels. Keep your arms straight and your shoulders back. Slowly lower the bar back to the ground and repeat the movement for 10-12 reps.</p><p><h2>The Plank</h2></p><p>The plank is another excellent exercise for targeting belly fat. It works on your core muscles, including your abs and obliques. It is a simple exercise that you can do anywhere, without any equipment. It is an isometric exercise, which means you hold the same position for an extended period.</p><p>Begin by getting into a push-up position with your arms straight and your body in a straight line. Hold the position for as long as you can, ideally for 30 seconds to one minute. Repeat the exercise for three to four sets.</p><p><h3>The Bench Press</h3></p><p>The bench press is a classic weight lifting exercise that targets your chest, triceps, and shoulders. It is an excellent exercise for building upper body strength and burning calories. It is also one of the best weight lifting exercises for belly fat.</p><p>Begin by lying on a flat bench with your feet flat on the ground. Grab the barbell with a slightly wider than shoulder-width grip. Lower the bar to your chest, and then press it back up to the starting position. Repeat the movement for 10-12 reps.</p><p><h4>How to Do Squats</h4></p><p>Squats are a compound exercise that works on multiple muscle groups, including your quadriceps, glutes, and core muscles. It is an excellent exercise for building lower body strength and burning calories. It is also one of the best weight lifting exercises for belly fat.</p><p>Begin by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing forward. Place the barbell on your shoulders and hold it with an overhand grip. Keep your back straight and lower your body by bending your knees. Keep your knees behind your toes and lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the ground. Push through your heels and lift your body back to the starting position. Repeat the movement for 10-12 reps.</p><p><h2>The Leg Press</h2></p><p>The leg press is an excellent exercise for building lower body strength and burning calories. It works on your quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes, making it one of the best weight lifting exercises for belly fat.</p><p>Begin by sitting on the leg press machine with your feet flat on the platform. Push the platform away from you until your legs are fully extended. Slowly lower the platform back to the starting position and repeat the movement for 10-12 reps.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q. How often should I do weight lifting exercises?</strong></p><p>A. You should aim to do weight lifting exercises two to three times a week, with a day of rest in between each session.</p><p><strong>Q.
