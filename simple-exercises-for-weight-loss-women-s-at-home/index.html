To do a push-up, start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart. Lower your body until your chest touches the ground, then push back up to the starting position. Repeat for 3 sets of 10-12 reps.</p><p>Push-ups are one of my favorite exercises because they require no equipment and can be done anywhere. They are also a great way to build upper body strength.</p><p><h3>3. Plank</h3></p><p>The plank is a great exercise for targeting the core muscles. To do a plank, start in a push-up position, then lower your forearms to the ground. Keep your body in a straight line from your head to your toes, and hold for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Repeat for 3 sets.</p><p>I have found that incorporating planks into my exercise routine has helped me strengthen my core muscles. It is a simple exercise that can be done at home without any equipment.</p><p><h4>4. Jumping Jacks</h4></p><p>Jumping jacks are a great exercise for getting your heart rate up and burning calories. To do a jumping jack, start with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Jump up and spread your legs apart while raising your arms above your head. Jump back to the starting position and repeat for 3 sets of 10-12 reps.</p><p>I like to do jumping jacks as a warm-up exercise before starting my workout. It is a simple exercise that requires no equipment and can be done at home.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Simple Exercises for Weight Loss Women's at Home</h2></p><p>There are many simple exercises that women can do at home to help them lose weight.
