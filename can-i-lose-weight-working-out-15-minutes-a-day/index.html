Aim to exercise for at least 15 minutes every day.</li></ul><h2>The Importance of a Healthy Diet</h2><p>While exercise is important for weight loss, it's not the only factor. A healthy diet is also crucial. Make sure you're eating a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive amounts of alcohol.
