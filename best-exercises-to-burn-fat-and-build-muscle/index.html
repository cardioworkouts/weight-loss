I tried running and doing cardio, but I didn't see any results. It wasn't until I started doing squats that I started to see a difference in my body.

It works multiple muscle groups at once, including your chest, shoulders, and triceps. When I first started doing bench press, I struggled with lifting the bar. It wasn't until I started lifting lighter weights and focusing on my form that I was able to lift heavier weights and see results.</p><p><h4>Pull-Ups</h4></p><p>Pull-ups are a great exercise for building upper body strength and burning fat. They work multiple muscle groups at once, including your back, shoulders, and arms. When I first started doing pull-ups, I struggled with lifting my body weight. It wasn't until I started doing assisted pull-ups and focusing on my form that I was able to do unassisted pull-ups and see results.</p><p><h2>Lunges</h2></p><p>Lunges are a great exercise for building lower body strength and burning fat. They work multiple muscle groups at once, including your legs, glutes, and core. When I first started doing lunges, I struggled with my balance. It wasn't until I started doing lunges with lighter weights and focusing on my form that I was able to do lunges with heavier weights and see results.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><b>Q: How many times a week should I do these exercises?</b></p><p>A: It's recommended to do these exercises 2-3 times a week, with rest days in between.</p><p><b>Q: Should I do these exercises in a specific order?</b></p><p>A: It's recommended to do compound exercises first, followed by isolation exercises. For example, you can start with squats, deadlifts, and bench press, followed by pull-ups and lunges.</p><p><b>Q: Can I do these exercises at home?</b></p><p>A: Yes, you can do these exercises at home with minimal equipment. You can use dumbbells, resistance bands, or even your own body weight.</p><p><b>Q: Should I do cardio with these exercises?</b></p><p>A: It's recommended to do cardio on rest days or after your strength training session. You can do cardio for 20-30 minutes at a moderate intensity.</p><p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p>In conclusion, the best exercises to burn fat and build muscle are compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once. These exercises include squats, deadlifts, bench press, pull-ups, and lunges. Incorporating these exercises into your fitness routine can help you achieve your fitness goals.
