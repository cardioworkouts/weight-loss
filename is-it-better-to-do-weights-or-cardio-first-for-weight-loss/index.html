One of the most common questions people have is whether they should do weights or cardio first for weight loss. The answer may surprise you!</p><h2>Pain Points</h2><p>When it comes to weight loss, many people struggle with finding a workout routine that works for them. There are so many options out there and it can be overwhelming to figure out where to start. On top of that, there is conflicting information about whether weights or cardio is better for weight loss. It's no wonder people feel confused and frustrated.</p><h2>Answer</h2><p>The truth is, both weights and cardio can be effective for weight loss. However, the order in which you do them can make a difference. If your goal is to build muscle and lose weight, then it's generally recommended to do weights first and cardio second. This is because lifting weights can help you build lean muscle mass, which can increase your metabolism and help you burn more calories overall. Doing cardio after weights can also help you burn more fat since your body will have already used up its glycogen stores.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>In summary, if your goal is weight loss, it's better to do weights first and cardio second. This can help you build lean muscle mass, increase your metabolism, and burn more calories overall. However, both weights and cardio are important for overall health and fitness, so it's important to incorporate both into your workout routine.</p><h2>Personal Experience with Weights First</h2><p>When I first started my weight loss journey, I was focused solely on cardio. I would spend hours on the treadmill or elliptical machine, hoping to burn as many calories as possible. However, I didn't see the results I was hoping for. It wasn't until I started incorporating weights into my routine that I started to see real changes in my body. I began to build lean muscle mass, which not only made me look better but also helped me burn more calories even when I wasn't working out.</p><h2>Personal Experience with Cardio First</h2><p>On the other hand, I know people who have had success with doing cardio first and then weights. One friend of mine prefers to do a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workout that combines both weights and cardio. She feels like doing cardio first helps her warm up and get her heart rate up, which makes the weight lifting portion of her workout more effective.</p><h3>More Detail on Weights First</h3><p>When you do weights first, your body is in a better position to build muscle since your glycogen stores are full. This means you'll be able to lift heavier weights and perform more reps, which can help you build lean muscle mass more quickly. Additionally, since weight lifting is a form of resistance training, it can help you burn more calories even after your workout is over. This is known as the "afterburn effect," and it can help you continue to burn calories for up to 24 hours after your workout.</p><h4>How To: Incorporate Weights First</h4><p>If you're new to weight lifting, it's important to start slowly and focus on proper form. You can start with bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges, and push-ups, and then gradually add weights as you get stronger. Aim to do two to three strength training sessions per week, with a focus on compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once.</p><h2>Personal Experience with Weights First (Continued)</h2><p>Nowadays, I always start my workouts with weights and then do cardio afterwards. I usually do a full-body strength training routine that includes exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench press. After I finish my weights, I'll either do some steady-state cardio on the treadmill or elliptical, or I'll do a HIIT workout that combines both weights and cardio.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: Can you still do cardio if you do weights first?</strong></p><p>A: Absolutely! Doing cardio after weights can be an effective way to burn more fat and calories.</p><p><strong>Q: How much cardio should I do if I do weights first?</strong></p><p>A: This depends on your goals and fitness level. Aim to do at least 20-30 minutes of cardio after your weight lifting session, and gradually increase the duration and intensity as you get stronger.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I do weights and cardio on the same day?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, you can definitely do both weights and cardio on the same day. Just make sure to give your muscles time to rest and recover between workouts.</p><p><strong>Q: Is it better to do weights or cardio first if I'm short on time?</strong></p><p>A: If you're short on time, it's better to do whichever workout you enjoy more first. Consistency is key when it comes to weight loss, so focus on finding a routine that you can stick to long-term.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>So, is it better to do weights or cardio first for weight loss? The answer is weights first! However, both weights and cardio are important for overall health and fitness, so make sure to incorporate both into your workout routine. Remember to start slowly, focus on proper form, and listen to your body. With time and consistency, you'll be well on your way to achieving your weight loss goals.</p></article>
