This can include exercises like squats, lunges, push-ups, and burpees. </p><p>Personally, I like to do a combination of bodyweight exercises and cardio exercises like jumping jacks and high knees. I also like to use a timer to keep track of my intervals. I usually do 30 seconds of high-intensity exercise followed by 30 seconds of rest or low-intensity exercise. I repeat this cycle for 20 minutes. </p><p><h4>How Often Should You Do HIIT Cardio Workouts at Home for Beginners?</h4></p><p>It is recommended that you do HIIT cardio workouts at home for beginners 2-3 times per week. This will give your body time to rest and recover between workouts. You can also incorporate other types of exercise into your routine, such as strength training and stretching. </p><p><h2>Conclusion of HIIT Cardio Workouts at Home for Beginners</h2></p><p>HIIT cardio workouts at home for beginners can be an effective way to achieve your fitness goals. They are designed to help you burn fat, increase your metabolism, and improve your cardiovascular health in a short amount of time. However, it is important to start slowly and gradually increase the intensity of your workouts over time. You should also make sure to warm up properly before each workout and cool down afterwards. </p></article>
