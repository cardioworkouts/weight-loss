Decide on your fitness goals and tailor your workout routine to achieve them. If your primary goal is to gain muscle mass, focus on lifting weights before doing cardio. Conversely, if you want to improve your cardiovascular health and endurance, prioritize cardio before lifting weights.</p><h4>Tips for a Balanced Workout Routine</h4><p>One way to ensure that you have a balanced workout routine is to incorporate both lifting weights and cardio into your workout. You can do this by alternating between lifting weights and doing cardio on different days or by doing both exercises in the same workout, starting with the exercise that aligns with your fitness goals.</p><h2>Conclusion of Is it Better to Lift Weights and then Do Cardio?</h2><p>In conclusion, the answer to the question of whether to lift weights before doing cardio depends on your fitness goals.
