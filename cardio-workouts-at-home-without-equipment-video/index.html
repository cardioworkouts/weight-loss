They are also versatile and can be modified to suit your fitness level.</p><h4>Mountain Climbers</h4><p>Mountain climbers are another challenging but effective cardio exercise that requires no equipment. To do this exercise, start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart and your feet together. Bring one knee up toward your chest and then switch to the other knee in a running motion.
