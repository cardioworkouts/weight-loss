My Personal Experience</h2><p>As someone who regularly does cardio workouts, I was curious about the effects of pre workout supplements. I decided to try taking pre workout before my morning run to see how it would affect my energy levels and endurance. The first time I took it, I felt a noticeable increase in energy and focus. However, about 30 minutes into my run, I started to feel jittery and anxious. My heart rate was elevated, and I had trouble catching my breath. While I was able to finish my run, I didn't feel as though the pre workout had provided the sustained energy I needed for a longer workout.</p><p>After this experience, I decided to experiment with different dosages and brands of pre workout. I found that by starting with a low dose and gradually increasing it over time, I was able to minimize the negative side effects and still experience the benefits of pre workout. However, I also learned that pre workout supplements are not a magic solution, and that I still needed to focus on nutrition, hydration, and rest in order to get the most out of my workouts.</p><h2>Can I Take Pre Workout Before Cardio?

Additionally, the long-term effects of pre workout supplements on cardiovascular health are not well understood, and there may be risks associated with long-term use. </p><h3>How to Safely Take Pre Workout Before Cardio</h3><p>If you do decide to take pre workout before cardio, there are some steps you can take to minimize the risks and maximize the benefits.
