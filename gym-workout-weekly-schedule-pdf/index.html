Are you looking to build muscle, lose weight, or increase your overall fitness level? Your workout schedule should reflect these goals and be tailored to your individual needs.</p><p>Personally, I like to start my workout schedule with a full-body workout on Mondays, followed by a rest day on Tuesday. On Wednesday, I focus on upper body exercises, such as bench press and pull-ups, and on Thursday, I do lower body exercises like squats and lunges. Friday is another rest day, and on Saturday and Sunday, I do a combination of cardio and core exercises.</p><p>It's important to remember that everyone's workout schedule will look different depending on their goals, fitness level, and personal schedule.
