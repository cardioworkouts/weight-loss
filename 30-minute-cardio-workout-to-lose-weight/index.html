Warm up before starting: This can include stretching, light cardio, or dynamic movements to prepare your body for the workout.</p><p>3. Incorporate intervals: Intervals involve alternating between high-intensity and low-intensity exercise, which can increase the effectiveness of your workout and burn more calories.</p><p>4.
