So let's get started!</p><p><h2>The Benefits of Running with Music</h2></p><p>Before we dive into the best running music 2021 has to offer, let's take a moment to discuss the benefits of running with music. First and foremost, music can help distract you from the physical discomfort of running. When you're listening to your favorite tunes, you're less likely to focus on the burning in your legs or the tightness in your chest. This distraction can help you push through your workout and stay focused on your goals.</p><p>Additionally, music has been shown to have a positive effect on mood. Listening to upbeat, high-energy music can help boost your mood and give you the confidence you need to tackle that next hill or sprint to the finish line. Running with music can also help improve your performance by synchronizing your movements with the beat of the music. This synchronization can help you run more efficiently and reduce the risk of injury.</p><p><h2>Creating the Perfect Running Playlist</h2></p><p>Now that you know the benefits of running with music, it's time to create the perfect running playlist. The key to a great running playlist is variety. You want to include a mix of fast-paced, high-energy songs as well as slower, more mellow tunes. This variety will help keep you engaged and motivated throughout your entire workout.</p><p>Another important factor to consider when creating a running playlist is the tempo of the music. The ideal tempo for running is between 120 and 140 beats per minute. This tempo has been shown to synchronize with the average runner's stride and can help improve performance. There are many apps and websites available that can help you find songs with the perfect tempo for your workout.</p><p><h3>The Top Running Songs of 2021</h3></p><p>Now that you know how to create the perfect running playlist, let's take a look at the top running songs of 2021.

The upbeat rhythm and catchy lyrics will keep you motivated and energized throughout your workout.</p><p><h4>3. "Good Days" by SZA</h4></p><p>If you're looking for a slower, more mellow tune for your cool-down, "Good Days" is the perfect choice. With a tempo of 60 beats per minute, it's the ideal song to help you wind down after a tough workout.</p><p><h4>4. "Montero (Call Me By Your Name)" by Lil Nas X</h4></p><p>This motivational rap anthem has a tempo of 178 beats per minute, making it the perfect song for a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workout or a fast-paced run. The empowering lyrics and catchy beat will keep you motivated and energized throughout your entire workout.</p><p><h2>Common Questions About Running with Music</h2></p><p><strong>Q: Is it safe to run with headphones?</strong></p><p>A: While running with headphones can be a great way to stay motivated and energized during your workout, it's important to be aware of your surroundings.
