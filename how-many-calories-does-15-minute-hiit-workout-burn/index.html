Not everyone has the luxury of spending hours working out, which is why HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) is becoming increasingly popular.

The idea is to push your body to its limits during the high-intensity periods, which can help you burn more calories in less time.</p><p>The number of calories that you burn during a 15-minute HIIT workout will depend on various factors, including your weight, age, gender, and the intensity of the workout. On average, you can expect to burn between 150-250 calories during a 15-minute HIIT workout.</p><p>In summary, a 15-minute HIIT workout can help you burn a significant number of calories, making it an effective way to lose weight and improve your fitness level.
