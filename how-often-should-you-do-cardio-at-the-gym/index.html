<meta name="description" content="Pin by Luis Gomez on Health Gym workout tips, Cardio, Fitness motivationAre you wondering how often you should do cardio at the gym? It can be a confusing topic, with so many different opinions out there. Some people say you should do cardio every day, while others recommend just a few times per week. It can be hard to know what&#39;s right for you.The truth is, the frequency of your cardio workouts depends on your fitness goals and your current fitness level. If you&#39;re trying to lose weight or improve your overall health, you may need to do cardio more often than someone who is just trying to maintain their current fitness level.So, how often should you do cardio at the gym? The general recommendation is to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio per week, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity cardio per week.
