If you are trying to lose weight or improve your cardiovascular health, then doing cardio before lifting weights might be the best option for you. However, if you are trying to build muscle mass, then doing cardio after lifting weights might be the better option for you.</p><p><h2>Cardio Before Lifting Weights</h2></p><p>When I first started working out, I used to do cardio before lifting weights. I wanted to lose weight and improve my cardiovascular health, so I thought that doing cardio first was the best option for me. After a few weeks, I started to notice that I was feeling tired and my strength was decreasing. I realized that I was not able to lift as heavy as I wanted to because I had already exhausted myself with cardio.</p><p>However, doing cardio before lifting weights has its benefits. It can help to warm up your body and get your heart rate up, which can help you burn more calories during your workout. It can also help to improve your cardiovascular health, which is important for overall health and wellbeing.</p><p><h2>Cardio After Lifting Weights</h2></p><p>After realizing that doing cardio before lifting weights was not the best option for me, I switched to doing cardio after lifting weights. I noticed that I was able to lift heavier weights and my strength was increasing. Doing cardio after lifting weights helped to cool down my body and prevented injury.</p><p>However, doing cardio after lifting weights can also have its drawbacks. It can be difficult to motivate yourself to do cardio after lifting weights, especially if you are feeling tired. It can also be time-consuming, as you will need to spend extra time at the gym.</p><p><h3>Factors to Consider</h3></p><p>Before deciding whether to do cardio before or after lifting weights, there are a few factors to consider. Firstly, you need to think about your fitness goals. Are you trying to lose weight or build muscle mass? Secondly, you need to think about your energy levels. If you are someone who has a lot of energy, then doing cardio before lifting weights might be the best option for you. However, if you are someone who gets tired easily, then doing cardio after lifting weights might be the better option for you.</p><p><h4>How To Decide</h4></p><p>If you are still unsure about whether to do cardio before or after lifting weights, then the best thing to do is to try both options and see which one works best for you. You could try doing cardio before lifting weights for a few weeks, and then switch to doing cardio after lifting weights for a few weeks, and see which one makes you feel better.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Do You Do Cardio Before or After Lifting Weights</h2></p><p>Whether you should do cardio before or after lifting weights depends on your fitness goals.
