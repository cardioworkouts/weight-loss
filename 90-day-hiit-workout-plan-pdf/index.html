The workouts are designed to be challenging but doable for beginners. Phase 2 increases the intensity of the workouts and focuses on building muscle and burning fat. Phase 3 is the most intense phase and is designed to push you to your limits.</p><p><h3>Phase 1: Weeks 1-4</h3></p><p>During phase 1, you will be doing a combination of HIIT workouts and strength training. The HIIT workouts will consist of 20-30 seconds of high-intensity exercise followed by 10-20 seconds of rest. The strength training will focus on building a foundation of strength through exercises like squats, lunges, and push-ups.</p><p><h4>Example Workout:</h4></p><p>Circuit 1:</p><p>- Squats (20 seconds)</p><p>- Rest (10 seconds)</p><p>- Push-ups (20 seconds)</p><p>- Rest (10 seconds)</p><p>- Jumping Jacks (20 seconds)</p><p>- Rest (10 seconds)</p><p>Repeat circuit 1 for 4 rounds</p><p><h2>Staying Motivated</h2></p><p>One of the keys to success with the 90 Day HIIT Workout Plan PDF is staying motivated.
