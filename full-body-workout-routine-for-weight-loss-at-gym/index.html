Bicycle Crunches - 3 sets of 10 reps each side</p><p>4. Leg Raises - 3 sets of 10 reps</p><p><h2>Q&amp;A</h2></p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How often should I do a full body workout routine for weight loss at the gym?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> It is recommended to do a full body workout routine 2-3 times per week, with at least one day of rest in between each session.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I still do cardio in addition to a full body workout routine?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, cardio is a great way to supplement a full body workout routine and further increase weight loss.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Do I need to use heavy weights in a full body workout routine?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> It is important to challenge yourself with weights, but you do not need to use heavy weights to see results.
