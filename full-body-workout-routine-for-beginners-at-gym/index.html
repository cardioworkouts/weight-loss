Start with 5-10 minutes of cardio, such as jogging on the treadmill or using the elliptical machine. You can also do some dynamic stretching, such as leg swings and arm circles, to get your blood flowing.</p><p><h2>Compound Exercises:</h2></p><p>Compound exercises work multiple muscle groups at once, making them efficient and effective. Here are some examples of compound exercises:</p><p><h3>1. Squats:</h3></p><p>Squats work your glutes, hamstrings, and quads. Start with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward. Lower your body as if you're sitting back into a chair, keeping your weight in your heels. Make sure your knees don't go past your toes. Keep your back straight and core engaged. Push back up to standing position.</p><p><h4>Tips:</h4></p><p>Start with bodyweight squats and work your way up to using weights. Make sure to keep your knees aligned with your toes and avoid arching your lower back.</p><p><h3>2. Deadlifts:</h3></p><p>Deadlifts work your back, glutes, and hamstrings. Start with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward. Bend down to grab the barbell with an overhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart. Keep your back straight and core engaged. Lift the barbell up to standing position, keeping it close to your body. Lower the barbell back down to the ground.</p><p><h4>Tips:</h4></p><p>Start with light weights and work your way up to heavier weights. Make sure to keep your back straight and avoid rounding your shoulders.</p><p><h2>Isolation Exercises:</h2></p><p>Isolation exercises target specific muscle groups and can help you build muscle definition. Here are some examples of isolation exercises:</p><p><h3>1. Bicep Curls:</h3></p><p>Bicep curls work your biceps. Start with a dumbbell in each hand, arms at your sides, palms facing forward. Curl the dumbbells up to your shoulders, keeping your elbows close to your body. Lower the dumbbells back down to your sides.</p><p><h4>Tips:</h4></p><p>Start with lighter weights and work your way up to heavier weights. Make sure to keep your elbows close to your body and avoid swinging your arms.</p><p><h3>2. Tricep Extensions:</h3></p><p>Tricep extensions work your triceps. Start with a dumbbell in both hands, arms above your head, palms facing each other. Lower the dumbbell behind your head, keeping your elbows close to your head. Raise the dumbbell back up to starting position.</p><p><h4>Tips:</h4></p><p>Start with lighter weights and work your way up to heavier weights. Make sure to keep your elbows close to your head and avoid arching your back.</p><p><h2>Cool-down:</h2></p><p>After your workout, it's important to cool down and stretch your muscles to prevent soreness. Do some static stretching, such as holding a hamstring stretch or a quad stretch, for 5-10 minutes.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer:</h2></p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How often should I do this full body workout routine for beginners at the gym?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> You can do this routine 2-3 times a week, with at least one day of rest in between.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I modify this routine if I have a pre-existing injury?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, make sure to talk to your doctor or physical therapist before starting any workout routine.
