These exercises are important for beginners because they allow you to get the most out of your workout and save time in the gym. Examples of compound movements include squats, deadlifts, push-ups, and pull-ups.</p><p>When starting out, it’s important to focus on perfecting your form with these exercises before moving on to more advanced variations. This will help you avoid injury and ensure that you’re getting the most out of your workout.</p><h3>How to Incorporate Cardio into Your Beginner Workout Routine</h3><p>Cardiovascular exercise is an important component of any workout routine. As a beginner, it’s important to start small and gradually increase intensity. A good starting point is 20-30 minutes of cardio, 3-4 times per week.</p><p>Examples of cardio include running, cycling, swimming, and jumping rope. It’s important to choose an activity that you enjoy, so that you’re more likely to stick with it long-term.</p><h4>Tips for Creating a Successful Beginner Workout Routine</h4><p>1.
