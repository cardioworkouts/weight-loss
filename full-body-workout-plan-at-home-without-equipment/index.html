With full body workouts, you can target all the major muscle groups in your body, including your legs, arms, chest, back, and core.</p><p>Additionally, full body workouts are great for improving cardiovascular health and increasing endurance.

This means that you can do them from the comfort of your own home, without having to invest in expensive gym equipment or memberships.</p><p><h2>How to Create a Full Body Workout Plan at Home Without Equipment</h2></p><p>Creating a full body workout plan at home without equipment is easier than you might think. The key is to focus on compound exercises that target multiple muscle groups at once. These exercises will give you the most bang for your buck and help you maximize your time.</p><p>Some great compound exercises to include in your full body workout plan include squats, lunges, push-ups, pull-ups, and planks.

To do a push-up, start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart. Lower your body until your chest touches the ground, then push back up. Repeat for three sets of 10 to 12 reps.</p><p><h4>3. Lunges</h4></p><p>Lunges are a great exercise for targeting your legs, glutes, and core. To do a lunge, step forward with one foot and lower your body until your back knee touches the ground. Keep your chest up and your front knee behind your toes. Repeat for three sets of 10 to 12 reps on each leg.</p><p><h4>4. Planks</h4></p><p>Planks are a great exercise for targeting your core, shoulders, and back. To do a plank, start in a push-up position and lower your body down onto your forearms. Keep your body in a straight line and hold for 30 to 60 seconds.</p><p><h2>FAQs</h2></p><p><strong>Q: How often should I do a full body workout plan at home without equipment?</strong><br> A: You should aim to work out for at least 30 minutes a day, three to four times a week.</p><p><strong>Q: Do I need any equipment to do a full body workout at home?</strong><br> A: No, you don't need any equipment to do a full body workout at home.
