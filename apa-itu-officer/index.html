They also work with other executives to develop and implement strategies that help the company achieve its goals. Meanwhile, a chief information officer (CIO) is responsible for managing the company's technology infrastructure, ensuring that it is up-to-date and secure.</p><p>One personal experience of an officer is that I have worked as a chief marketing officer (CMO) in a media company for three years.
