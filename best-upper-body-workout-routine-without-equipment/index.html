Not everyone has the luxury of having a gym membership or the time to commute to the gym. Plus, using machines can be intimidating, especially if you're a beginner. That's why we've come up with the best upper body workout routine without equipment, so you can get a great workout from the comfort of your own home.</p><p>The best upper body workout routine without equipment includes a variety of exercises that target your chest, back, shoulders, and arms. These exercises can be done using just your body weight, so you don't need any equipment. The key to a successful upper body workout routine is to focus on compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once, rather than isolation exercises.</p><p>To sum it up, the best upper body workout routine without equipment includes compound exercises that target your chest, back, shoulders, and arms, and can be done using just your body weight. Now, let's dive into the details of each exercise.</p><p><h2>Push-Ups</h2></p><p>Push-ups are a classic exercise that targets your chest, shoulders, and triceps. To do a push-up, start in a high plank position, with your hands shoulder-width apart and your feet hip-width apart. Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping your body in a straight line. Push back up to the starting position, and repeat. If push-ups are too difficult, you can modify them by doing them on your knees or against a wall.</p><p><h2>Dips</h2></p><p>Dips are another great exercise that targets your triceps, shoulders, and chest. To do dips, find a sturdy chair or bench and sit on the edge. Place your hands on the edge of the chair or bench, with your fingers facing forward. Slide your butt off the chair or bench and lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows. Push back up to the starting position, and repeat.</p><p><h3>Pull-Ups</h3></p><p>Pull-ups are a challenging exercise that targets your back, shoulders, and arms. To do a pull-up, find a sturdy bar that can support your weight. Grab the bar with your palms facing away from you and your hands shoulder-width apart. Pull your body towards the bar, keeping your elbows close to your body. Lower yourself back down to the starting position, and repeat. If pull-ups are too difficult, you can modify them by doing negatives or assisted pull-ups.</p><p><h4>Burpees</h4></p><p>Burpees are a full-body exercise that target your chest, shoulders, arms, and legs. To do a burpee, start in a standing position. Squat down and place your hands on the ground. Kick your feet back into a plank position, do a push-up, and then jump your feet back towards your hands. Stand up and jump, reaching your arms towards the ceiling. Repeat.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Best Upper Body Workout Routine Without Equipment</h2></p><p>The best upper body workout routine without equipment includes push-ups, dips, pull-ups, and burpees.
