Or maybe you're a DJ looking for some new tracks to mix into your set. One important factor to consider when selecting songs is the tempo, or beats per minute (BPM). 140 BPM is a popular tempo for many different genres of music, including pop, hip-hop, and electronic dance music (EDM). In this article, we'll explore some popular songs that are 140 BPM and why this tempo is so popular.</p><p>When it comes to selecting music for workouts or DJ sets, tempo can be a crucial factor. Music that is too slow can make it difficult to stay motivated, while music that is too fast can be overwhelming and exhausting. 140 BPM is a popular tempo because it strikes a balance between these two extremes. It's fast enough to get your heart pumping and your feet moving, but not so fast that it's impossible to keep up.</p><p>So, what songs are 140 BPM? Here are some popular examples:</p><h2>Pop Songs</h2><p>Many popular pop songs are around 140 BPM, making them perfect for workouts or dance parties. Some examples include:</p><p>- "Can't Stop the Feeling" by Justin Timberlake</p><p>- "Uptown Funk" by Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars</p><p>- "Shape of You" by Ed Sheeran</p><p>- "Bang Bang" by Jessie J, Ariana Grande, and Nicki Minaj</p><h2>Hip-Hop Songs</h2><p>140 BPM is also a popular tempo for hip-hop music. Here are some examples:</p><p>- "Jumpman" by Drake and Future</p><p>- "No Limit" by G-Eazy ft. A$AP Rocky and Cardi B</p><p>- "All the Way Up" by Fat Joe and Remy Ma ft. French Montana</p><p>- "Money Longer" by Lil Uzi Vert</p><h2>EDM Songs</h2><p>Electronic dance music (EDM) is known for its high energy and fast tempos, and 140 BPM is no exception. Here are some popular 140 BPM EDM tracks:</p><p>- "Levels" by Avicii</p><p>- "Animals" by Martin Garrix</p><p>- "Toulouse" by Nicky Romero</p><p>- "Strobe" by Deadmau5</p><p>In conclusion, 140 BPM is a popular tempo for many different genres of music, including pop, hip-hop, and EDM. Songs at this tempo can be great for workouts or dance parties, as they are fast enough to get your heart pumping without being too overwhelming. Some popular examples include "Can't Stop the Feeling" by Justin Timberlake, "Jumpman" by Drake and Future, and "Levels" by Avicii. So next time you're putting together a playlist, consider adding some 140 BPM tracks to the mix!</p><h2>Why is 140 BPM Such a Popular Tempo?</h2><p>As we mentioned earlier, 140 BPM strikes a balance between being fast enough to keep you energized, but not so fast that it's impossible to keep up. This makes it a great tempo for many different activities, including workouts, dance parties, and even just listening to music while you work or study.</p><p>Personally, I love listening to music at 140 BPM when I'm working out. It's the perfect tempo for running or doing cardio, as it helps me maintain a steady pace without getting too exhausted. It's also a great tempo for dancing, as it's fast enough to keep things exciting, but not so fast that you can't keep up with the beat.</p><h2>How Can I Find More Songs at 140 BPM?</h2><p>If you're looking for more songs at 140 BPM, there are a few different ways to find them. One option is to use a music streaming service like Spotify or Apple Music, which allow you to browse playlists and search for songs by tempo.</p><p>You can also use a website like songbpm.com, which allows you to search for songs by BPM. Simply enter "140" into the search bar, and the site will pull up a list of songs at that tempo.</p><h3>What Are Some Other Popular Tempos?</h3><p>While 140 BPM is a popular tempo, it's certainly not the only one. Other popular tempos include:</p><p>- 120 BPM: This is a common tempo for dance music, including many EDM and house tracks.</p><p>- 160 BPM: This tempo is popular for fast-paced genres like drum and bass, and is also commonly used for running and other workouts.</p><p>- 90 BPM: This tempo is popular for many different genres of music, including hip-hop, pop, and rock.</p><h4>How Can I Tell What Tempo a Song Is?</h4><p>If you're not sure what tempo a song is, there are a few different ways to find out. One option is to use a website like songbpm.com, which can analyze a song and tell you its BPM.</p><p>You can also use a smartphone app like Tempo Slow or BPM Tap, which allow you to tap along to a song and determine its tempo.</p><h2>Conclusion of What Songs are 140 Beats Per Minute</h2><p>140 BPM is a popular tempo for many different genres of music, including pop, hip-hop, and EDM.
