Additionally, you can alternate between cardio and strength training workouts throughout the week to achieve a balance.</p><h2>Personal Experience with Cardio Before Working Out</h2><p>As a fitness enthusiast, I have tried both doing cardio before and after my workout. I find that doing cardio before my workout helps me warm up my muscles and get my heart rate up. However, I always make sure to limit my cardio to 10-15 minutes and focus on low-intensity exercises such as walking, cycling, or rowing.</p><p>On the other hand, doing cardio after my workout helps me burn additional calories and cool down after my workout. Additionally, doing cardio after my workout helps me improve my endurance and cardiovascular health.</p><h2>Question and Answer Section</h2><h3>Q: Is it better to do cardio before or after strength training?</h3><p>A: It depends on your fitness goals.
