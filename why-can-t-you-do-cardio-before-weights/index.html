Purdy’s Wharf</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Are you someone who likes to hit the treadmill before hitting the weights at the gym? Well, you may want to think again. While cardio is a great way to warm up and get your heart rate up, doing it before weights can actually hinder your performance and results.</p><h2>Pain Points of Doing Cardio Before Weights</h2><p>Have you ever noticed that you feel tired and fatigued after a long cardio session? This is because cardio depletes your glycogen stores, which are your body's primary source of energy. When you deplete these stores, you won't have enough energy to perform at your best during weightlifting.</p><p>Additionally, cardio can increase cortisol levels in the body, which is a stress hormone that can break down muscle tissue. This can lead to decreased muscle growth and strength gains.</p><h2>Answering the Target of Why Can't You Do Cardio Before Weights</h2><p>The reason why you shouldn't do cardio before weights is that it can deplete your energy stores and increase cortisol levels, which can hinder your performance and results. Instead, it's recommended to do a short warm-up, such as dynamic stretching, before diving into weightlifting.</p><p>After weightlifting, you can do cardio as a cool-down to help improve endurance and burn extra calories.</p><h2>Summary of Main Points</h2><p>In summary, doing cardio before weights can lead to decreased energy levels, increased cortisol levels, and hindered performance during weightlifting. It's recommended to do a short warm-up and save cardio for after weightlifting.</p><h2>Explaining the Target of Why Can't You Do Cardio Before Weights</h2><p>Personally, I used to always hit the treadmill before hitting the weights at the gym. However, I noticed that my energy levels were low, and I wasn't able to lift as heavy or perform as many reps as I wanted to.</p><p>After doing some research, I learned that doing cardio before weights can deplete your glycogen stores, which are crucial for energy during weightlifting. I also learned that cardio can increase cortisol levels, which can break down muscle tissue and hinder muscle growth.</p><p>Now, I make sure to do a short warm-up, such as dynamic stretching, before diving into weightlifting. After weightlifting, I'll do cardio as a cool-down to help improve endurance and burn extra calories.</p><h2>The Effects of Cardio on Weightlifting</h2><p>Cardio and weightlifting have different effects on the body. Cardio is great for improving endurance, burning calories, and improving cardiovascular health. Weightlifting, on the other hand, is great for building muscle, increasing strength, and improving overall body composition.</p><p>When you do cardio before weights, you're depleting your energy stores and increasing cortisol levels, which can hinder your performance during weightlifting. This can lead to decreased muscle growth and strength gains.</p><h3>The Science Behind It</h3><p>A study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that participants who did cardio before weights had significantly lower strength and power output than those who did weights before cardio. This is because cardio depletes glycogen stores, which are crucial for energy during weightlifting.</p><h4>How to Optimize Your Workout</h4><p>If you want to optimize your workout, it's recommended to do a short warm-up, such as dynamic stretching, before diving into weightlifting. This will help increase blood flow and warm up your muscles for weightlifting.</p><p>After weightlifting, you can do cardio as a cool-down to help improve endurance and burn extra calories. This will also help prevent muscle soreness and stiffness.</p><h2>Personal Experience with Doing Cardio Before Weights</h2><p>Personally, I used to always do cardio before weights, thinking that it would help me burn more calories and improve my overall fitness. However, I noticed that I was always tired and fatigued during weightlifting and wasn't able to lift as heavy or perform as many reps as I wanted to.</p><p>After doing some research, I learned that doing cardio before weights can deplete your energy stores and increase cortisol levels, which can lead to decreased muscle growth and strength gains. Now, I make sure to do a short warm-up before diving into weightlifting and save cardio for after.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: Can I do cardio and weights on the same day?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, you can do cardio and weights on the same day. However, it's recommended to do weights before cardio to optimize your performance and results.</p><p><strong>Q: How long should I wait to do cardio after weights?</strong></p><p>A: It's recommended to wait at least 30 minutes to an hour after weights before doing cardio. This will allow your body to recover and prevent muscle soreness and stiffness.</p><p><strong>Q: What type of cardio is best after weightlifting?</strong></p><p>A: Low-impact cardio, such as walking or cycling, is best after weightlifting. This will help improve endurance and burn extra calories without putting too much stress on your muscles.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I skip warm-up before weightlifting?</strong></p><p>A: No, it's not recommended to skip warm-up before weightlifting. Warm-up helps increase blood flow and warm up your muscles, which can prevent injury and optimize your performance.</p><h2>Conclusion of Why Can't You Do Cardio Before Weights</h2><p>Doing cardio before weights can lead to decreased energy levels, increased cortisol levels, and hindered performance during weightlifting. It's recommended to do a short warm-up and save cardio for after weightlifting. By optimizing your workout, you can improve your overall performance and results.</p></article>
