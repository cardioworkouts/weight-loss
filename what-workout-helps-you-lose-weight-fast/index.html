While I did lose some weight, I realized that I was losing muscle mass as well. That&#39;s when I decided to incorporate strength training exercises like weight lifting into my routine.The results were incredible! I started to see a noticeable difference in my body composition, and my metabolism also increased. I was burning fat even when I wasn&#39;t working out, which was a game-changer for me.Strength Training Exercises:The best strength training exercises for weight loss include squats, lunges, deadlifts, and bench presses. These exercises target multiple muscle groups and help build lean muscle mass.Squats:Squats are an excellent exercise for building leg muscle and burning fat. To perform a squat, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and lower your body as far as you can by pushing your hips back and bending your knees. Make sure to keep your back straight and your core engaged.Lunges:Lunges are another great exercise that targets your leg muscles. To perform a lunge, step forward with one foot and lower your body until your front knee is at a 90-degree angle.
