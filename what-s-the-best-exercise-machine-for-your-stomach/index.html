Keep your body in a straight line from your head to your heels and hold the position for as long as you can.How to Use the MachinesWhen using the treadmill or rowing machine, make sure to engage your core muscles throughout the workout. This means keeping your posture straight and your stomach tight. Start with a low resistance and gradually increase as you get stronger.For the plank, aim to hold the position for at least 30 seconds to start, and gradually increase the time as you get stronger.ConclusionThe best exercise machine for your stomach is the one that targets your core muscles and provides resistance to improve their strength and tone.
