Without a plan, you may find yourself wasting time trying to decide which exercises to do or not pushing yourself enough to make progress.</p><p>The target of a weekly gym workout plan template is to provide you with structure and consistency in your workouts.

Next, decide how many days per week you want to work out and how long each session will be.</p><p>Once you have an idea of what you want to accomplish and how much time you have to work with, you can start creating your plan.
