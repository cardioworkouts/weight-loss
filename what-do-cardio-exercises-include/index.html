It can help to reduce stress and anxiety, boost your mood, and improve your overall sense of well-being. Plus, it can improve cognitive function and memory.</p><p><h2>How to Get Started with Cardio Exercises</h2></p><p>Getting started with cardio exercise can be intimidating, especially if you're new to fitness. However, there are plenty of resources available to help you get started.</p><p>First, it's important to talk to your doctor before starting any new exercise program. They can help you determine what level of exercise is safe and appropriate for you.</p><p>Next, start slowly and gradually increase your intensity and duration over time.

These can lead to injury or hinder your progress. Here are a few mistakes to avoid:</p><p><h3>Skipping Warm-Up and Cool-Down</h3></p><p>Skipping your warm-up and cool-down can increase your risk of injury and muscle soreness. Make sure to spend at least 5-10 minutes warming up before your workout and 5-10 minutes cooling down afterwards.</p><p><h3>Overdoing It</h3></p><p>Starting off too fast or doing too much too soon can lead to burnout or injury. Start slowly and gradually increase your intensity and duration over time.</p><p><h3>Sticking to One Exercise</h3></p><p>Sticking to one type of exercise can lead to boredom and plateauing. Mix up your routine with different types of cardio exercises to keep things interesting.</p><p><h3>Not Listening to Your Body</h3></p><p>It's important to listen to your body and rest when needed.

You can also invest in equipment like a treadmill or stationary bike.</p><p>Q: Do I need any special equipment for cardio exercises?</p><p>A: No, you can do cardio exercises with little to no equipment. However, if you want to invest in equipment, options include a treadmill, stationary bike, or elliptical machine.</p><p>Q: Should I do cardio exercises before or after strength training?</p><p>A: It's generally recommended to do cardio exercises after strength training. This is because strength training can deplete your energy levels, making it harder to perform cardio exercises at a high intensity.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of What Do Cardio Exercises Include</h2></p><p>In conclusion, cardio exercises include any physical activity that increases your heart rate and breathing rate.
