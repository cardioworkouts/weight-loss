It's an excellent way to get your heart rate up, burn calories, and improve your overall health. Try to walk for at least 30 minutes daily, and gradually increase the duration and intensity of your walks. </p><p> Jogging/Running: If you are looking for a more intense aerobic workout, jogging or running can be a good option. You can start with a slow jog and gradually increase the pace and distance over time. However, be sure to wear comfortable shoes and stretch before and after your workout to prevent injury. </p><p> Cycling: Cycling is another low-impact exercise that can be done indoors or outdoors.

Walking can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, and improve your mental health and well-being. </p><p> Personally, I started walking as a form of exercise during the pandemic when gyms were closed. I would walk around my neighborhood for 30 minutes every day, and gradually increased the duration and pace over time.

I started with a slow jog for 10 minutes and gradually increased the duration and intensity of my workouts over time. I noticed that my breathing improved, and I had more stamina throughout the day. </p><p> To make your jogging/running routine more enjoyable, you can try running with a friend or a pet, listening to music, or exploring new routes.
