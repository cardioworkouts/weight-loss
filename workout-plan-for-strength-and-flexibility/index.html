Strength refers to the ability of your muscles to exert force, while flexibility refers to the range of motion of your joints. Both are important for preventing injuries, improving posture, and enhancing athletic performance.</p><p>When you have strong muscles, you are better able to perform daily activities such as lifting and carrying objects.

By improving both your strength and flexibility, you can improve your overall quality of life.</p><h2>How to Create a Workout Plan for Strength and Flexibility</h2><p>Creating a workout plan for strength and flexibility can seem daunting, but it doesn't have to be. The following steps will help you create a plan that is tailored to your individual needs and goals:</p><ol><li>Define your goals: What do you want to achieve with your workout plan?
