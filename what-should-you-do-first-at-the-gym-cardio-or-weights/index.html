YouTube</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Are you new to the gym and wondering what you should do first: cardio or weights? It can be overwhelming to walk into a gym and not know where to start. But don't worry, in this article, we will guide you through the pros and cons of each and give you the information you need to make the best decision for your fitness goals.</p><h2>The Pain Points of Choosing Between Cardio and Weights</h2><p>Choosing between cardio and weights can be a difficult decision, especially if you're not sure what your fitness goals are. It can also be frustrating if you're not seeing the results you want, but don't know if you're doing the right exercises.</p><h2>What Should You Do First at the Gym: Cardio or Weights?</h2><p>The answer to this question depends on your fitness goals. If you're looking to lose weight, then starting with cardio is a good choice. This will help you burn calories and increase your heart rate, leading to weight loss. On the other hand, if you're looking to build muscle, then starting with weights is the way to go. This will help you build muscle mass and increase your strength.</p><p>Another option is to combine cardio and weights into one workout. This is a great way to get the benefits of both types of exercise. You can start with a cardio warm-up, move on to weights, and finish with a cardio cool-down. This will help you burn calories, build muscle, and improve your overall fitness.</p><h2>My Personal Experience with Cardio and Weights</h2><p>When I first started going to the gym, I was intimidated by the weights section. I stuck to cardio for a few months, but I wasn't seeing the results I wanted. I decided to try weights and noticed a significant difference in my strength and muscle mass. I now combine cardio and weights into my workouts and feel stronger and healthier than ever.</p><h2>The Pros and Cons of Cardio and Weights</h2><p>Cardio and weights each have their own benefits and drawbacks. Cardio is great for weight loss, improving heart health, and reducing stress. However, it can be time-consuming and repetitive. Weights are great for building muscle, increasing strength, and improving bone density. However, they can be intimidating and require proper form to avoid injury.</p><h3>Tips for Starting a Cardio or Weight Routine</h3><p>If you're new to cardio or weights, it's important to start slow and gradually increase the intensity of your workouts. This will help prevent injury and ensure that you're seeing results. It's also important to stay hydrated and fuel your body with healthy foods.</p><h4>How to Stay Motivated</h4><p>Staying motivated can be difficult, especially if you're not seeing results right away. It's important to set realistic goals and track your progress. This will help you see how far you've come and motivate you to keep going. It's also helpful to find a workout buddy or join a fitness class to stay accountable and motivated.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Q: Is it better to do cardio or weights first?</h3><p>A: It depends on your fitness goals. If you're looking to lose weight, then starting with cardio is a good choice. If you're looking to build muscle, then starting with weights is the way to go. You can also combine cardio and weights into one workout.</p><h3>Q: How long should I do cardio?</h3><p>A: It's recommended to do at least 30 minutes of cardio per day, five days a week. However, this can vary depending on your fitness goals and current fitness level.</p><h3>Q: How often should I lift weights?</h3><p>A: It's recommended to lift weights at least two to three times a week. However, this can vary depending on your fitness goals and current fitness level.</p><h3>Q: Can I do cardio and weights on the same day?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can combine cardio and weights into one workout. It's important to start with a warm-up, move on to weights, and finish with a cool-down.</p><h2>Conclusion of What Should You Do First at the Gym: Cardio or Weights</h2><p>When it comes to choosing between cardio and weights, there is no one-size-fits-all answer. It depends on your fitness goals and personal preferences. Whether you choose to do cardio, weights, or a combination of both, the most important thing is to stay consistent and stay motivated. With time and dedication, you'll reach your fitness goals and feel healthier and stronger than ever.</p></article>
