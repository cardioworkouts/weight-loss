This will help you burn some extra calories and increase your cardiovascular fitness without interfering with muscle recovery.</p><p>However, if your goal is to lose weight and improve your overall fitness, you can do cardio for up to 30-45 minutes after your weightlifting session. This will help you burn more calories and improve your cardiovascular endurance.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>In summary, the length of your cardio session after lifting weights depends on your goals. If you want to build muscle and strength, limit your cardio to 15-20 minutes. If you want to lose weight and improve overall fitness, you can do cardio for up to 30-45 minutes.

If you want to build muscle and strength, it's best to limit your cardio to 15-20 minutes.
