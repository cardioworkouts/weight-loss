However, there are some exercises that are more effective than others when it comes to losing weight in these areas.</p><p>The best exercise to lose belly fat and love handles is a combination of strength training and cardiovascular exercise.

Keep your back flat and hold this position for as long as you can.</p><p><h3>2. Russian Twists</h3></p><p>Russian twists are a great way to target your obliques, which are the muscles on either side of your abs. To perform a Russian twist, sit on the floor with your knees bent and your feet flat on the ground. Lean back slightly and lift your feet off the ground. Hold a weight in your hands and twist your torso to the left, then to the right.</p><p><h2>The Best Cardiovascular Exercises for Losing Belly Fat and Love Handles</h2></p><p>Some of the best cardiovascular exercises for losing belly fat and love handles include:</p><p><h3>1.
