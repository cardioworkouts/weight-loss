Running after lifting doesn't ruin your workout. In fact, it can be beneficial in some ways. Running helps you burn more calories, improves your cardiovascular health, and aids in muscle recovery. However, the order in which you do these exercises matters. If you do cardio before weightlifting, it can affect your strength and endurance. But doing cardio after weightlifting can improve your performance.</p><p>Moreover, it's crucial to give your muscles enough time to recover after weightlifting. If you're doing both exercises on the same day, make sure to leave a gap of at least 30 minutes between them. This way, your muscles will have enough time to recover before you start running.</p><h2>Main Points</h2><p>In summary, running after lifting doesn't ruin your workout.

This way, you'll prevent injury and improve your overall performance.

This way, you'll have more energy and strength to perform both exercises.</p><h3>Q: How long should I wait to run after lifting?</h3><p>A: Wait at least 30 minutes before running after lifting. This way, your muscles will have enough time to recover.</p><h3>Q: Can running after lifting cause injury?</h3><p>A: Running after lifting can cause injury if you don't warm up properly or don't give your muscles enough time to recover. Make sure to stretch before and after exercising and leave a gap of at least 30 minutes between weightlifting and running.</p><h3>Q: Can running after lifting help me lose weight?</h3><p>A: Yes, running after lifting can help you burn more calories and lose weight. However, it's important to maintain a balanced diet and exercise routine to see results.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Running after lifting doesn't ruin your workout.
