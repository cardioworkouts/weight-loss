After a few weeks of consistent tricep dips, I noticed a significant improvement in the size and definition of my arms.</p><h3>3. Hammer Curls</h3><p>The target of hammer curls is to improve the size and strength of your forearms. To perform this exercise, hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing your body.
