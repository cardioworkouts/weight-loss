Others may be concerned about muscle loss or other negative effects on their health.</p><p>The good news is that fasted cardio can be safe and effective for most people, as long as you follow a few basic guidelines. Here's how to do fasted cardio in the morning:</p><p>First, choose your exercise. Running, cycling, and swimming are all great options for fasted cardio, but you can also try jumping jacks, burpees, or other bodyweight exercises if you prefer. Just make sure to choose an activity that you enjoy and that gets your heart rate up.</p><p>Next, decide on your intensity level. For beginners, it's best to start with a moderate intensity level and gradually increase as you become more comfortable. Aim for a heart rate of around 50-70% of your maximum heart rate. You can use a heart rate monitor or simply go by how you feel.</p><p>Once you've chosen your exercise and intensity level, it's time to get started. Here are some tips for how to do fasted cardio in the morning:</p><p><h2>Start Slow</h2></p><p>Don't jump right into a high-intensity workout on an empty stomach. Start with a lower intensity level and work your way up gradually over time. This will help your body adjust to the new routine and prevent any negative side effects.</p><p><h2>Stay Hydrated</h2></p><p>Even though you're not eating before your workout, it's still important to stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout to avoid dehydration and keep your energy levels up.</p><p><h2>Eat a Balanced Breakfast Afterwards</h2></p><p>After your workout, make sure to eat a balanced breakfast that includes protein, fiber, and healthy fats. This will help replenish your energy stores and prevent muscle loss.</p><p><h2>Mix It Up</h2></p><p>Don't do fasted cardio every day. Mix it up with other types of exercise or take a rest day in between workouts. This will help prevent burnout and keep you motivated.</p><p><h2>FAQs About How to Do Fasted Cardio in the Morning</h2></p><p><h3>Q: Is fasted cardio safe?</h3></p><p>A: Fasted cardio can be safe for most people, as long as you follow a few basic guidelines.
