It is characterized by the thickening of the heart muscle, which can lead to a variety of symptoms and complications. While the exact cause of kardiomiopati hipertrofik is unknown, it is thought to be a genetic condition that runs in families.</p><p>If you have been diagnosed with kardiomiopati hipertrofik, it is important to work closely with your healthcare provider to manage your symptoms and reduce your risk of complications. Treatment options may include medications to improve heart function, lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, and in some cases, surgery to remove excess heart tissue.</p><p>In summary, kardiomiopati hipertrofik is a heart condition that causes the heart muscle to thicken and become stiff, making it harder for the heart to pump blood efficiently.
