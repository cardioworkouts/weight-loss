This is a common question among gym-goers, and the answer can vary depending on your fitness goals. In this article, we will explore whether you can do cardio before weights and the benefits and drawbacks of doing so.</p><h2>Pain Points Related to Can You Do Cardio Before Weights</h2><p>Many gym enthusiasts struggle with deciding whether to do cardio before or after weights. There is often confusion about the order of these exercises and how it can impact your fitness goals. Some may worry that doing cardio before weights can tire them out, making it harder to lift weights. Others may be concerned that doing weights before cardio can make them too tired to complete a full cardio session.</p><h2>Can You Do Cardio Before Weights?</h2><p>The short answer is yes; you can do cardio before weights. However, there are pros and cons to this approach. If your goal is to increase endurance and burn calories, cardio before weight lifting may be the best option. Doing cardio first can also help warm up your muscles and prevent injury during weight lifting. However, if your goal is to build muscle mass and strength, doing weights before cardio may be more beneficial. This is because weight lifting requires more energy and effort, and doing cardio beforehand can leave you feeling fatigued and unable to lift heavy weights.</p><p>Ultimately, the decision of whether to do cardio before or after weights depends on your fitness goals and personal preferences. It’s important to experiment with both approaches to see which one works best for you.</p><h2>Benefits and Drawbacks of Doing Cardio Before Weights</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, doing cardio before weights can have its advantages and disadvantages.
