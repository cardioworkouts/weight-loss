Not only do they work your arms, but they also work your chest, shoulders, and core. To do a push-up, start by getting into a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart. Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, then push yourself back up to the starting position. Repeat this for as many reps as you can.</p><p>Personally, I love doing push-ups because they are challenging and effective. When I first started doing push-ups, I could barely do one. But with consistent practice, I can now do multiple sets of push-ups without stopping. Push-ups have helped me build strength in my arms and chest.</p><h2>Dips</h2><p>Dips are another great arm workout that require no equipment. They primarily work your triceps, but they also work your shoulders and chest. To do a dip, find a sturdy surface like a chair or bench. Place your hands on the surface behind you with your fingers facing forward. Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, then push yourself back up to the starting position. Repeat this for as many reps as you can.</p><p>Personally, I find dips to be a challenging exercise, but they are effective in building strength in my triceps. When I first started doing dips, I could only do a few reps. But with consistent practice, I can now do multiple sets of dips without stopping.</p><h3>Plank Shoulder Taps</h3><p>Plank shoulder taps are an arm workout that require no equipment but are also great for your core. They work your shoulders, triceps, and core. To do a plank shoulder tap, start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart. Lift one hand off the ground and tap the opposite shoulder. Lower your hand back to the ground and repeat on the other side. Repeat this for as many reps as you can.</p><p>Personally, I love plank shoulder taps because they challenge my core and work my arms at the same time. When I first started doing plank shoulder taps, I could only do a few reps. But with consistent practice, I can now do multiple sets of plank shoulder taps without stopping.</p><h4>Chair Dips</h4><p>Chair dips are another great arm workout that require no equipment. They primarily work your triceps, but they also work your shoulders and chest. To do a chair dip, find a sturdy chair or bench. Face away from the chair with your hands on the seat and your feet on the ground. Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, then push yourself back up to the starting position. Repeat this for as many reps as you can.</p><p>Personally, I find chair dips to be a challenging exercise, but they are effective in building strength in my triceps.
