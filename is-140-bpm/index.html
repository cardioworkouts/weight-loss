These symptoms can be caused by a high or low heart rate, which can indicate an underlying health condition. It is essential to know your normal heart rate range and monitor any changes to your heart rate to ensure optimal health.</p><p>So what is 140 bpm? 140 bpm stands for 140 beats per minute, which is the average heart rate for a person during moderate to intense exercise. This means that when you exercise at this intensity, your heart is pumping blood at a rate of 140 beats per minute.
