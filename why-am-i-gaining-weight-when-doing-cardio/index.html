As we mentioned earlier, muscle weighs more than fat, so this can result in weight gain. It is a good sign as it means you are getting stronger and more toned. However, it is essential to keep a check on your food intake and exercise routine to ensure that you are on the right track.</p><p><h3>High-Calorie Intake</h3></p><p>One of the main reasons for gaining weight when doing cardio is a high-calorie intake. It is essential to keep a check on your food intake and ensure that you are not consuming more calories than you are burning. You can also consult a nutritionist to help you plan a healthy diet that complements your exercise routine.</p><p><h4>How to Overcome Weight Gain When Doing Cardio?</h4></p><p>To overcome weight gain when doing cardio, you need to focus on your calorie intake and exercise routine. Keep a check on your food intake and ensure that you are not consuming more calories than you are burning. Incorporate strength training into your exercise routine to help build muscle and burn fat. Consult with a trainer or nutritionist to help you plan a healthy diet that complements your exercise routine.</p><p><h2>Why Am I Gaining Weight When Doing Cardio? - Personal Experience</h2></p><p>After being on a cardio routine for a few weeks, I noticed that I was gaining weight instead of losing it. I was confused and frustrated, but after consulting with a trainer, I realized that I was not incorporating strength training into my exercise routine. Once I started incorporating strength training, I noticed that I was losing weight and feeling stronger.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q: Can cardio help in weight loss?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, cardio can help in weight loss, but it is essential to keep a check on your calorie intake and exercise routine.</p><p><strong>Q: How often should I do cardio?</strong></p><p>A: It is recommended to do cardio for at least 30 minutes, five days a week.</p><p><strong>Q: Can muscle gain result in weight gain?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, muscle weighs more than fat, so muscle gain can result in weight gain. </p><p><strong>Q: Should I consult with a trainer or nutritionist?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, consulting with a trainer or nutritionist can help you plan a healthy diet and exercise routine that complements your weight loss goals.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Why Am I Gaining Weight When Doing Cardio</h2></p><p>Gaining weight when doing cardio can be frustrating, but it is essential to understand the reasons behind it.
