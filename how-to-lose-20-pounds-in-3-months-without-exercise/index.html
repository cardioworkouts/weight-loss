Practice Mindful EatingMindful eating is the practice of paying attention to your food and eating habits. By practicing mindful eating, you can learn to recognize when you&#39;re full, avoid overeating, and make healthier food choices. Some tips for mindful eating include eating slowly, chewing your food thoroughly, and avoiding distractions while eating.Question and AnswerQ: Can I still eat carbs?A: Yes, you can still eat carbs, but it&#39;s important to choose complex carbs like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Avoid processed carbs like white bread, pasta, and sugary snacks.Q: Do I need to count calories?A: While counting calories can be helpful, it&#39;s not necessary.
